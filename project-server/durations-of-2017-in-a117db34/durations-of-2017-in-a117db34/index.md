This Zip file contains a 2016 and a 2007 file format MPP. In it there is a set of tasks with the correct durations for:

- the year

- the quarters

- the months

Using these files as a guideline you are sure to grab the correct duration for a specific time. For instance, you want to have a resource allocated for the whole time in Q2 2017 for 40% of his/her max units? This file will provide you with the correct duration  and a task that you can use for this purpose.

The file is useful for organizations that have long running projects, without to much detail in the schedule.

Thanks for downloading!
