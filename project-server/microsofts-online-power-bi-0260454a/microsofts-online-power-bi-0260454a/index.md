## Output from Technet Gallery

This file is based upon Microsoft's content pack for Project Online and contains the following modifications.

**Currency** : the user is prompted to enter their currency when they open the template, and combined with the locale set in the Options under Regional Settings ensures that currency values are displayed in the user's local currency.

**Time **: Additional time fields have been added to reports, allowing the user to drill down into weeks. This is useful especially on visualisations such as the Resource Heatmap. The model includes dates from 2013 to 2023.

**Page Level Filters** : Reports such as resource assignments and resource availability have had relative time filters added, such as 7 months (to provide a valid 6 month look ahead) or 1 year.

**TimePhased Data** : Some of the reports have been duplicated and appended with (TP). These reports show TimePhased data values.

**Drill through** : has been added for resources on the Resource Availability and Work (TP) page.

**Buttons** allowing viewing of by month, week or day for Resource Availability have been added.** **

**Engagements** : An Engagement report is included into the model.

**Additional reports **: A report combining resource work and availability has been provided.

**Additional Filters**** : **Some reports have slightly modified filters to provide a better user experience.
