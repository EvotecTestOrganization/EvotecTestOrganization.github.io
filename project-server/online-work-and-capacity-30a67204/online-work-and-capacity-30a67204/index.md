This Power BI template file provides resource work and capacity charts for Project Online resources.  It makes use of a DAX measure to ensure a full set of contiguous timephased work values and hence provides for readable line charts.  Combined with a filter based upon resource names it's easy to see when resources are overloaded!  It uses standard Project Online data fields and so will work out of the box with all Project Online and Project Server (2013/2016) solutions.
