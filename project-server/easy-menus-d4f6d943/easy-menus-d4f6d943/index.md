# Project Easy Menus

Project Easy Menus are a customised CUI file that simplify the menu experience in Microsoft Project in two ways.

1. The menu tabs relate to your current project management process (project creation, project execution or project reporting) rather than Microsoft's functional areas of tasks, resources, views etc.

2. Buttons that are infrequently used by the majority of users are removed (please note that this is my assessment only having run hundreds of project courses over the years).

** **

3.  Really popular buttons have been added to two or more menus.

4.  Users can take this menu structure and modify it to suit their own needs.

If you have already made customisations, click on the Import/Export button and Export and save your current customisations.  Once this is done, Import the** Project Easy Ribbon** file.
