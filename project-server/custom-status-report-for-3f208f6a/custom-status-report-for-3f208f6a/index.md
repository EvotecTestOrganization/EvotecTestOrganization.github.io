The Custom Project Status Report for Microsoft Project offers a collection of useful information about key project data.Â It has been developed to help Project Managers get quick insights about their projects in a simple and objective way. Once older versions of Microsoft Project (such as Project 2010 or Project 2007) do not offer the beautiful Visual Reports that come with Project 2013 and 2016, this Project Status report offers an opportunity for users to export the data from Microsoft Project to Microsoft Access and then connect it to the report in order to have useful information that can be refreshed once the project is updated.
