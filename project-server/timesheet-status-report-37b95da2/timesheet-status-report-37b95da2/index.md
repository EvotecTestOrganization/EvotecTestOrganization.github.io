This document will describe to you how to create a Timesheet Status Report in a filterable and sortable table format which include timesheets in a status of Not Yet Created... something Project Online reporting does not deliver. The report gathers the Not  Yet Created criteria from the base capacity a resource have in a given week. Where they're capacity is greater than 0, a timesheet would be required.

Update: The original download included an auto-correct mistake in the "advanced editor code". Case matters very much, but I didn't catch that Word auto capitalized the "in" in the let.... in... statement. This is corrected in this version.
