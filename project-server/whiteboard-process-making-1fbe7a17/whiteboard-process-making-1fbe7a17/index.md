From beginning to end, here is the whiteboard animation procedure for making your own video:

**Stage 1: Define Your Goals **

You need to ask yourself; what are the results you expect or the goals you need to achieve.

Listing down the goals that you have in your mind, For instance, 'if you need to build the client change rate on the landing page' or if you need to expand the transformation rate by 20% on your social media platform.  Being sure about your objectives  helps you achieve your target. It enables you on making a more defined content. Through your goals, you can have a better understanding of what key messages and suggestion you need to add to take action.

**Stage 2: Make Your Script **

your whiteboard [video animation sharks](https://animationsharks.com/) won't be able to change the viewers into your potential clients if you don't have an awesome content or script. Conveying the desired information completely relies upon your  script, so take as much time as it needs to make a well-written and understandable script. Work out on different drafts to locate the one that can works best for you.

It is crucial that you sort out and see the majority of your client's needs and concerns.  You can even try to ask some of those concerns from your team and discover what points are important to focus. At that point, you would have the surety of what  to answer in your video. The information has to be adequately put inside the content because your script is your story. The story that your clients can identify and would consider when they need to oblige.

**Stage 3: The Voiceover **

You can enlist an expert voiceover artisan, who can cost a couple of hundred pounds relying upon involvement. However, with the help of a pro, you can get a decent video.

In your whiteboard process while picking the artist for voice over, ensure that you have a voice that will connect well with your targeted audience (for instance, if your targeting only females, you have a female voice or when you are aiming for teenagers,  you have a fresh, more lively voice). Voice over can make and destroy your video, if not dealt properly. So make sure you deliver the best voice that your audience would want to hear.

As a general guideline, however, the voiceover can dependably be peppy and vivacious keeping in mind your goal is to get your audience connected.

**Stage 4: Create Sketches **

You need to picture your content and then accordingly draw different portrayals or sketches. Initially, they can be unpleasant to look or difficult to draw. But that’s what it is all about, you need to “Try”. By trying, you start to get  the hold of your character or visuals; you simply have to ensure you get the majority of your thoughts down on paper.

If you find this whiteboard process troublesome, making it impossible to interoperate something from your content, don't get panicked, simply do your best and it will turn out inventively well.

**Stage 5: The Storyboard **

Close by the content, choose what pictures you need to utilize and, place them according to the requirement and the position they will show up on screen. Doing so, you will be able to pre-picture the video and that would even save your time by evacuating  any issues that previously you encountered.

If you like, you can examine those issues through Photoshop; it’s a simple method that helps you scan your storyboard. This option gives you the additional advantage of playing around and reshaping your pre-picture into whatever shape you like.

**Stage 6: Create Guides **

Since you have your representations and your final sketches all together, now you need to redraw them VERY daintily on the page. They should be sufficiently dim to be seen by your eye, yet swoon enough for the camera not to lift them up – you don't  need a bundle of rules appearing in your last video.

**Stage 7: Record Video **

Keep in mind, the video that you make can be shown speedy, so move at a pace that suits your content and voice over. You need to trust your instinct for that.

If you want to take breaks when vital, try not to be reluctant. Since your whiteboard animation is not a live video, you can change, alter or add accordingly at the end.

**Stage 8: Sync and connect your Audio and Video **

By utilizing any video programming software, you need to synchronize your visuals with your voiceover.

At this stage, cut out any oversights and extra parts. You can even apply different channels to influence the paper to look exceptionally white and the lines extremely black.

**Conclusion **

In the end, you just need to make sure that the lighting is steady and you include any pertinent credits or logos in your video.  Although the whiteboard animation process varies according to requirements, through these steps, you can make a decent  and good whiteboard animation for yourself.
