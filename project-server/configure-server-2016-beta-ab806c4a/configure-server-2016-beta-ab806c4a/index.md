## Output from Technet Gallery

The following PowerShell scrips provisions SharePoint 2016 Technical Preview Beta 2

Warning:  There is no error trapping or testing to determine if something is

 already in place. My intention with this script is to execute line by line and if

 an error occurs, then determine the cause and skip or fix the issue.

There are a few new things in this script, such as creating the project server

 services and providing the license key. Also, create PWA with SharePoint sites

 within this collection.
