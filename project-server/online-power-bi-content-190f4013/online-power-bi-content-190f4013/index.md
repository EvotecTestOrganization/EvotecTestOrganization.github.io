## Output from Technet Gallery

Based on the **Project Online PowerBI content pack v2** provided by Microsoft in November 2017, this updated version proposes a**weekly timescale**. The TIMESET table has been updated with the week dimension (format YYYY-WW). Both time dimensions are available (month and week). The weekly dimension has been added in place of the former monthly dimension but you can always revert back to the initial monthly dimension from the TIMESET table.

Here are the steps to use the file, which is a PowerBI template (PBIT format):

1. Open the file with PowerBI desktop

2. Authenticate with your PWA tenant credentials

3. Enter the PWA URL as a parameter when prompted

4. Enjoy the dashboard
