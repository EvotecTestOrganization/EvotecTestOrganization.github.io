The Contoso Project Spend Report User Guide walks you through using the Project Spend Report particularly the use of a key concept -- a unifying Expense Code, to track Project Total Actual Cost.  The Total Actual Cost is then categorized into its component costs by project work alongside sustainment and common services activities maintained in associated projects in lieu of Administrative Time and Timesheet entries in order to facilitate cost categorization by Expense Code.

The Contoso Project Spend Report Source Code defines the requisite custom data configuration to drive the data categorization requirements of the Project Spend Report.  It also  describes how to add the Project Spend Report to the Project Server 2010 v2 Demo Virtual Machine.  The Project Spend Report and supporting files are provided in this download.

The Project Server 2010 v2 Demo VM can be downloaded from the [Download Microsoft Project Server 2010 page](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/ee410540.aspx) on the TechNet Evaluation site.

The Project Spend Report was created by Emmanuel Fadullon, a Principal Consultant for Microsoft Consulting Services.
