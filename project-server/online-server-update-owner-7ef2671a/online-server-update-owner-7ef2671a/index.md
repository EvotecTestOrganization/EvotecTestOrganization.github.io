## Output from Technet Gallery

This simple JavaScript file enables you to change the Owner field / label on the Project Detail Pages to display a different label such as Project Manager.

The script does require a jQuery library to work - these are detailed on the blog post below. The idea of this script is to add the script to theÂ PWA Project Detail Page via a content editor web part. For details see the blog post below:
