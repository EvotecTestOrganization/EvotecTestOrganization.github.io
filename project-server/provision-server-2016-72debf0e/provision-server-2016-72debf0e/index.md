## Output from Technet Gallery

Provisioning project server is not as easily as it was in the past.  SharePoint Central does not include a menu option in project servers to create, edit and remove a PWA site.  The PowerShell scripts are examples of several ways to provision project  server 2016.

PowerShell shows several ways to provision from the ROOT or multiple PWA sites such as PWA, PWA2 and PWAOOB.

There is also a script to show what PWA sites have been provisioned and finally a powershell command to remove a provision site.
