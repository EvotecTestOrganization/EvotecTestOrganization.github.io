This Power BI file contains reports for Microsoft's office 365 PPM tool Project Online. This is the first release of the report pack, I plan to update this in the near future and publish later versions. The report connections will need to be updated to access  the target PWA instance, these steps for updating the parameter are covered in the supporting blog post here:
