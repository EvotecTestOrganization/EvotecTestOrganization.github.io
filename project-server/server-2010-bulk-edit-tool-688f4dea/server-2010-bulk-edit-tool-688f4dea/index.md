Changing custom fields or other project fields for a single project is easy using Project Professional or PWA. Changing the same fields on multiple projects, however, can be a challenge. Using either Project Professional or PWA, each project must be edited  individually, making “bulk editing” a tedious and time consuming task. The Bulk Edit Tool solution starter provides a solution for this problem. The solution is accessible via the PWA ribbon in Project Center.

Please note, this Bulk Edit tool was relased as part of Solution starter 2010. Since its been rertired and not available on technet site any more, i am uploading the last tested version i am using for others.
