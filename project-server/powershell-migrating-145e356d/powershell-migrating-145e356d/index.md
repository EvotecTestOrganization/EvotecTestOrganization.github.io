## Output from Technet Gallery

The PowerShell script provides the steps for migrating Project Server content databases and project database to Project Server 2016 technical preview beta 2.

There is no error checking and skipping steps if steps have already been done.   For example,if an application pool is already created and you run the script again, the script will error when trying to recreate.
