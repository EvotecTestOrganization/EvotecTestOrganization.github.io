## Output from Technet Gallery

//Update - March 2020// - All dates are now of type Date meaning you can create your own DAX calcs between the dates and the labels are split into 6 separate columns.

//Update - February 2020// - The charts now support the priority field and additional charts have been created to display the tasks by priority and a decomposition tree.

This Power BI template replicates the charts feature in Planner, and provides additional drill through capability by plan or resources.  It imports the exported Excel planner files from a common folder, providing the ability to view multiple plans at once.  It also provides the ability to drill-though to see task details by resource / project, allowing the viewer to see which task are remaining, the status, due dates and the number of remaining tasks.   The file also splits assignments, so if a task is assigned to two resources, the assignment is counted and displayed individually for each resource.
