There are situations when a project manager leaves or moves to a different area within the organization and someone else is taking over his/her projects. This Powershell scriptfinds the projects owned by the old project manager and replaces the owner with  the new project manager.

The script will need to be updated with the correct PWA url and the user guids. Also, the script may throw an error if some of the projects to be updated are already checked out by a different user.
