### Remove All Network Printers When Users Logoff

This script will remove all network printers at user logoff. We need to be used this script in the user logoff settings via GPO.

We use this script to remove stale/old network printer connections from user workstations. This helps to reduce user confusion by taking away printer connections that may not be available anymore. We also use this script in case there are any major printer  infrastructure changes.
