In your server environments sometimes to get the details of printers on a print server people need to log-in to the print server, open MMC console, go to print management, add servers and then get to see the printer details.

This is a Powershell script which is invoked by the batch file in the main folder does that all for you. Running the batch file would give a prompt asking for server name and credentials for the server.
